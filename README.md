# REST API for Shift Management
### Requirements
Python 3.7 or newer, pip, pytest for python 3

### Instalation
Clone repo & change directory to project home  
```
git clone https://github.com/dont-worry-be-happy/test.git
cd shifts
```

Optionally create python virtual environment and activate it : https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html

Install python libraries:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running API server
The following command starts server on port 5000
```
python main.py 
```
### Running tests
Just type: 
```
pytest
```
...or run tests from IDE of your choice

# Notes
### Requirements
The following requirements were not clear just from email  

"Build a REST application" - I wasn't sure if you meant 
full application with UI and REST backend but decided to build 
just backend endpoint

"It is a 24 hour timetable" - not sure what ir means, decided that 
shift can start any time and any time  
 
Note: In regular work situation I would NEVER:exclamation: proceed without clarification!

### The good parts
- API meets requirements
- code would be easy to extend to fully fledged app

### The bad parts 
- worker tables/storage/REST resources are not implemented, 
  worker is represented by Id only 
- parameter checks for shift begin/end values not implemented
- non integer IDs for shifts/workers not tested
- not tested from security perspective: SQL injection etc, 
SQLAlchemy should limit risks but tests are needed anyway 

### The ugly parts
- DB content is cleaned each time tests are executed
- tests need to be run in sequence as they depend on DB content generated by previous tests  
- some tests rely on sequence of records returned by application
- there are some Python warnings generated by flask/alchemy libs by default out of the box
- some tests are result of copy/paste
